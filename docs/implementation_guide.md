# PyRAG: Python Documentation RAG System
## Comprehensive Implementation Guide

### Executive Summary

PyRAG is an open-source RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system specifically designed to keep AI coding assistants current with the latest Python library documentation. By providing real-time access to up-to-date API references, examples, and best practices through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), PyRAG solves the critical problem of AI assistants suggesting outdated or deprecated code patterns.

## Technical Architecture

### System Components

#### 1. Documentation Ingestion Pipeline
**Purpose**: Automated collection and processing of Python library documentation

**Components**:
- **Multi-Source Scrapers**
  - Sphinx documentation processors (NumPy, SciPy, Django)
  - MkDocs parsers (FastAPI, Pydantic)
  - GitHub repository monitors (READMEs, wikis, release notes)
  - PyPI metadata extractors
  - Official tutorial crawlers

- **Change Detection System**
  - RSS/Atom feed monitoring
  - GitHub webhook integrations
  - PyPI release API monitoring
  - Content hash-based change detection
  - Scheduled deep crawls for sites without notifications

#### 2. Document Processing Engine
**Purpose**: Transform raw documentation into semantically meaningful, retrievable chunks

**Hierarchical Chunking Strategy**:
```
Library Level: requests
├── Module Level: requests.auth
│   ├── Class Level: HTTPBasicAuth
│   │   ├── Method Level: __call__()
│   │   │   ├── Signature chunk
│   │   │   ├── Description chunk  
│   │   │   └── Example chunk
│   │   └── Full class context chunk
│   └── Module overview chunk
└── Library overview chunk
```

**Content Enrichment**:
- Parameter type extraction from docstrings
- Deprecation status tracking with replacement suggestions
- Version compatibility mapping
- Cross-reference relationship preservation
- Code example validation and testing

#### 3. Vector Database Layer
**Purpose**: Efficient storage and retrieval of embedded documentation

**Multi-Index Architecture**:
- **Semantic Index**: Dense embeddings for conceptual searches
- **Code Index**: Specialized embeddings for function signatures and patterns
- **Example Index**: Optimized for usage pattern matching
- **Keyword Index**: Traditional search for exact API names

**Metadata Schema**:
```json
{
  "content": "Documentation text content",
  "library": "requests",
  "version": "2.31.0",
  "hierarchy": ["requests", "auth", "HTTPBasicAuth", "__call__"],
  "content_type": "method_description|example|signature|overview",
  "dependencies": ["urllib3", "certifi"],
  "related_concepts": ["authentication", "sessions"],

  "confidence_score": 0.95,
  "last_updated": "2024-12-01T10:30:00Z"
}
```

#### 4. Retrieval System
**Purpose**: Intelligent, context-aware document retrieval

**Multi-Stage Process**:
1. **Query Analysis**: Intent detection, library identification, specificity assessment
2. **Multi-Index Search**: Parallel queries across all indexes with result fusion
3. **Context Assembly**: Hierarchical context gathering and relationship mapping
4. **Reranking**: Score adjustment based on recency, popularity, deprecation status
5. **Response Construction**: Structured output with examples and related information

#### 5. MCP Server Interface
**Purpose**: Standardized integration with AI coding assistants
