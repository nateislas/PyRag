## 🔧 Key Features Implemented

### GraphRAG Capabilities

#### Knowledge Graph Operations
```python
# Build knowledge graph from documents
knowledge_graph = KnowledgeGraph(vector_store)
await knowledge_graph.build_graph_from_documents(documents)

# Multi-hop queries
result = await knowledge_graph.multi_hop_query(
    "Compare requests vs httpx for async HTTP requests",
    max_hops=3
)
```

#### Relationship Extraction
```python
# Extract API relationships
extractor = RelationshipExtractor()
relationships = extractor.extract_relationships(content)

# Extract API paths and dependencies
api_paths = extractor.extract_api_paths(content)
dependencies = extractor.extract_dependencies(content)
```

#### Query Planning
```python
# Plan complex queries
planner = QueryPlanner()
plan = await planner.plan_query("Build a web API using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy")

# Execute plans
result = await planner.execute_plan(plan)
```

#### Multi-Hop Reasoning
```python
# Execute reasoning chains
engine = ReasoningEngine()
result = await engine.reason(
    "How to build a web API using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy",
    context={"libraries": ["fastapi", "sqlalchemy"]}
)
```

### Library Management Features

#### Library Discovery
```python
# Discover popular libraries
discovery = LibraryDiscovery()
libraries = await discovery.discover_popular_libraries(limit=10)

# Get library suggestions by category
web_frameworks = await discovery.get_library_suggestions("web_frameworks")
```

#### Quality Assessment
```python
# Assess documentation quality
assessor = QualityAssessment()
metrics = await assessor.assess_library_quality("requests")

# Calculate quality scores
quality_score = assessor._calculate_quality_score(library_info)
popularity_score = assessor._calculate_popularity_score(library_data)
```

#### Update Pipeline
```python
# Monitor and process updates
pipeline = UpdatePipeline()
