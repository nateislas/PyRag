# Professional Development Standards

## COMMUNICATION FIRST
- **Always explain your plan before implementing**
- **Ask for confirmation when approach is unclear**
- **Describe what you're building and why**
- **Break down complex tasks into smaller steps**

## Code Quality Focus
- Write production-ready code, not just working code
- Include proper error handling from the start
- Add meaningful comments for complex logic
- Consider scalability and maintainability

## Development Workflow
- **Start with the minimum viable implementation**
- **Get basic functionality working first**
- **Add features incrementally**
- **Validate each step before proceeding**

## Integration Approach
- **Study existing code patterns before writing new code**
- **Match the existing architecture and style**
- **Reuse existing utilities and components when possible**
- **Don't reinvent what already exists**

## Time Management
- Focus on core functionality over edge cases
- Prioritize working code over perfect code
- Be prepared to explain design decisions
- **Stop and reassess if you're writing more than 50 lines without testing**
